Owned expansion : Forgotten circles

WOW. I can&apos;t emphasize enough how amazing this game is. Best game of 2017 for me, hands down. This is like a dream come true, I couldn&apos;t have asked for better. If you like Legacy games and dungeon crawls... please make yourself a gift and get this. You cannot not play this!

#1 BEST Dungeon crawl
#1 BEST Legacy game
#1 BEST Cooperative game

Also one of my SO&apos;s favorite games.

Update after 25 plays : I have now played 25 games of Gloomhaven on normal mode (23W-2L) in 3 weeks and I still can&apos;t wait to play some more. I haven&apos;t played a single other board game since I joined this amazing world. I prefer it with 2 or 3 players. With 4 it&apos;s a bit too long (I&apos;ve played 1 game, but the scenario was pretty long also) but I&apos;d need to try it again just to be sure.

Update after ending the main story: We have now returned to playing other games as there is less addiction to unlock stuff and since we &quot;finished&quot; the game. But boy this was the only thing we could get ourselves to play in 2-3 months. We played over 80 hours I&apos;m pretty sure and we were playing mostly 2-player. This game has a lot to unravel. But for some reason when the campaign was finished we completely stopped. I must say the last two characters we unlocked and played were support characters and the combination in a 2-player game was less interesting."/>

Its gameplay definitely favors its Eurogame roots, but it offers RPG growth/customization, story, and legacy consequences. There are many important decisions, both tactical and strategic. Four-player sessions can take a few hours, but we still sometimes play multiple scenarios in a day, when we have the time."/>

                     value="Gloomhaven is, at the time I wrote this, the #1 ranked game on BGG.  I think the consistently high ratings are well deserved.  I have really enjoyed the 7.5 games I&apos;ve played so far (we&apos;re mid-mission right now!).

Gloomhaven is, first and foremost, a kind of optimization puzzle that you solve with 1-3 of your friends.  It has received much criticism because the puzzle is mostly the same, which I think misses the point.  This an excellent puzzle, with a large number of truly meaningful decisions, and scenarios that have very finely honed difficulty.  It&apos;s like a book of Crosswords or Sodoku - if you don&apos;t like the puzzle, a whole book will seem boring.  But if you like the puzzle, then it&apos;s great.  I find the puzzle of Gloomhaven to be absolutely enthralling, and the scenarios do a great job, IMO, of mixing it up enough that I don&apos;t feel like I&apos;m just rinse and repeating my way through the game.  YMMV.  If you&apos;re thinking about buying it, you should know that you can play the first scenario for FREE with any of the first 6 classes on Tabletopia.  See if you like the puzzle before sinking $100 into it.

Aside from the main game, Gloomhaven&apos;s scenarios and campaign are really a labor of love, and it shows throughout.  There are way more enemies here than there really need to be, but it sure is nice to not fight the same 6 enemies all the time.  The standees work well, and keep the game affordable, so I appreciate them even if I still want minis.  Likewise for the character classes - 17 is more variety than most people will ever see, but it&apos;s there for those who want to explore.  I love that you are supposed to play the game to unlock the classes.  Each individual class has an individual set of higher level cards that become accessible as they level up, plus individualized perks that make their modifier deck better.  The modifier deck is brilliant, by the way, and the way you can improve it is simple yet fantastic - one of the many &quot;little&quot; touches that makes Gloomhaven such an amazing creation.

Lastly, I want to mention that I am currently playing Gloomhaven with my kids, who are 11, 9, and 7.  My youngest definitely needs a lot of help figuring out what she wants to do.  I give the 9yo some advice each turn about general group strategy and he plays competently, although not always optimally.  My 11yo plays with zero advice (he wouldn&apos;t listen anyway), and plays very well.  It&apos;s been a great experience."/>

                     value="Incredible game. Certainly not perfect and I had hoped for more outside of the combat, but what is there is very entertaining. Haven&apos;t tired of it yet.

The primary focus of the game is the card play for your actions and the optimization puzzle that presents. Things are dynamic enough that situation never plays out the same and you have a multitude of solutions to getting through things. It takes about 3+ play throughs to see all content. The reality is that your game is going to go differently than someone elses.

The game gives off a rpg video game vibe with branching story decision paths as well as which missions you choose to complete and when influencing how things play out. Fire Emblem/final fantasy tactics the board game? Less Baulders gate and more tactical strategy Jrpg mixed with some Mage Knight &quot;lite&quot;. That may sound like the best thing ever to you or the worst.

Some may prefer games like Shadows of Brimstone over this game. Certainly do your research before buying this. This is definitely a euro game design style. No dice chucking.

Looking forward to what else this designer comes up with.

The version I got was $60 from the first kickstarter. A friend of mine wants it now but he has to pay $140. Ouch. It&apos;s a great game and if I had to do it again I&apos;d pay the $140 but no more than that.

I rate the game a 9 because the legacy aspect makes a score of 10 impossible if strictly going by BGG&apos;s ranking descriptions. However I would unofficially declare it a 10 while you are playing it.

edit: I should also note that I find this game very compelling. Probably the most compelling board game I own. I want to play this every chance I get. I want to play it like I do my most favorite computer games. I have  board games I like a lot, but nothing this compelling to date. This game is really a 10 on my list. It is one of my top 10. Certainly one of my top 5.

edit: I have since found ways to make the game non-permanent. Removable stickers and resources have made it possible for us to replay this numerous times now. So I have bumped my rating up to a 10. Seriously one of the very best games I&apos;ve played and owned to date."/>

                     value="This game is a solid ten. It is the [i]only[/i] ten in my collection. It is [i]that[/i] good. The base of the game is it&apos;s tactical dungeon crawling mechanics and they are breathtaking. But what elevates this [i]masterpiece[/i] to the upper echelons of glory and immortality in the hobby is the legacy aspects. You aren&apos;t destroying things, you are [i]building[/i]. Improving the town, unlocking new (wildly varied) classes, slowly sussing out the secrets of the town, the world, opening envelopes, discovering secrets and watching it all unfold before you. Retiring characters gives you new experiences, both as classes and town/road events where you encounter your retired characters. It also gives you access to a book which further fleshes out the world. Some argue the game doesn&apos;t have enough story but there is enough there to enthrall me and help keep my interested in enjoying the marvelous system that Isaac Childres has created, and the world he has envisioned. Everyone I have put this in front of has said something similar, if you can find this for a reasonable price, buy it. Hell, even if the price is [i]slightly[/i] unreasonable, you should still buy it. It&apos;s worth every penny.

You can read my review [geekurl=/thread/1720130/welcome-gloomhaven-initial-impressions-now-50-less]here[/geekurl] if you&apos;re interested. It is by far my best review, but it&apos;s also the longest."/>

Wow, the last time I was so exited while playing a game was when I played my first game of Mage Knight. The gameplay feels so awesome that Isaac must have spent a very long time polishing it. I immediately want to play this again!

                     value="A simply incredible game.  On one level, it&apos;s a dungeon crawler, but the mechanics of battle using the cards, combined with &quot;resting&quot; and the variable levels/difficulty of the dungeons makes for every scenario being interesting and frequently quite challenging.

Where the game shines though (and gets a 10) is in the campaign.  Unlocking new scenarios, advancing along your personal quest, interacting with the larger world and seeing the city of Gloomhaven grow and improve (or not!).  The non-Tolkien nature of the world is also a breath of fresh air.  Very fun and highly recommended.

                <notes value="Greetings everyone!

After over 500 hours of gameplay and finishing the whole package, I decided to pass on my Gloomhaven.
It is the second print with the solo scenarios included.

The game has been completly finished, so let me give you a heads up right here:
~ The game is in a good condition. It is used over about 500 hours but has always been treated carefully and was stored appropriatly.
~ The game box endured some carrying around.
~ Some monster standees are a little torn because the included standee holders sometimes are very tight.
~ ALL components are available, with a minor exception of the non used global achievment stickers regarding other path choices.

~ All Stickers have been mounted onto the world map, aswell as the global achievments following our playthrough; Also, a good amount of cards have been enhanced.
(We used the available stickers from the base game, NOT the removeable ones!)
~ The Worldmap has been framed into a picture frame. (I am willing to include this as a separate package if desired; if not the frame will be removed, the map folded and stored into the original box)
~ All Character boxes, envelopes and other stuff has been opened of course!

~ ALL cards have been sleeved with the original docsmagic sleeves and are additionally stored inside zip-bags if necessary. There are still a lot of left-over sleeves/bags that I will also include.
~ ALL map tiles are properly stored alphabetically in an accordion folder.
~ ALL items are stored in a proper folder which is treated as a &quot;shop&quot; this way. (Locked items turned down, unlocked items faced up)
~ Road/City events, random dungeon generator and life time goals are stored in a 4-divided-limpid box.
~ ALL the remaining parts of the game have been carefully sorted and stored into plano boxes.

Accommodates ability, attack modifier and item cards in separate dividers, plus class tokens and the miniature (for most classes). For storage, the health/xp dial, character sheet and character mat/card are placed on top.

You can totally use during play also, so it&#039;s really a win-win. This organizer would also probably work for many other tabletop games, like Scythe, Founders of Gloomhaven, Terraforming Mars, etc.

                <notes value="Help pass the days stuck in home with this deluxe Wall and Floor set for Gloomhaven the Boardgame.
-I built this set using the plans from Hirst Arts (https://www.hirstarts.com/gloom/gloom.html). I played through the entire campaign using this set and it adds soo much to our game nights. You become much more immersed with the 3D set and it looks gorgeous on the table.
-All pieces are made out of dental stone, molded, primed and hand inked and painted.
-The bottom of each piece is layered with cork or foam so table tops are not scratched.
-The pieces have a satisfying weight to them.
A substantial amount of time went into building this set, over 80 hours ? Each piece needs to be built individually and glued together. Then primed, dry brushed with numerous layers, lacquered with a matte finish, bottom finished with cork or foam, and finally labeled (floor tiles).
-The floor tiles are labeled to correspond with the tiles in the game. Pictured below is scenario 1. I built the scenario showing double doors because I thought it looked cool, but you can build it anyway you want. This shows the flexibility you have when building the rooms. Floor tiles required for that scenario are L, G, and I. I have a label on the back of each tile.
Whats included:
All floor pieces to run every scenario in the base game. -30-
Enough wall pieces to run any scenario in the base game -54-
6 doors molded and painted
6 crates
2 tables
3 barrels
6 single floor spaces to link boards together.
-Once purchased I will send you a video to make a storage box. Unfortunately, with shipping constraints I&#039;m not able to send the box I normally used to store the pieces. With pick up you&#039;ll have the storage boxes.
-This set is unfortunately heavy. Shipping base cost is set to $100. I will adjust from there for location. The optimal purchase would be pickup, I understand that&#039;s not always available.

Only played this solo once.  I have placed stickers on map for first two locations and dare not remove to thwart any damage to board.  This will not affect play at all.  All hidden boxes are unopened as I never reached any goals in the game.  Four plastic boxes (see photos) will be shipped with game as they hold most needed game counters and/or monster standees.  The game is in pristine gaming condition along with the box.

Shipping:
I will probably send this in two boxes to prevent damage to core game box.
Local pickup in Frederick Maryland area also works.

I accept any of the following four methods of payment:

                <notes value="This includes the first edition of Gloomhaven (including minis and cypher postcard), the reprinted solo scenarios, the reprinted rulebook, the reprinted scenario book, four health/exp trackers, the Forgotten Circles expansion, the re-usable sticker set for the base game, and the re-usable sticker set for the Forgotten Circles expansion. I played through almost the full campaign for the original game. The Forgotten Circles expansion is open, but un-played.

I took a couple of hours to re-set the game to essentially the initial state that it would be in when you opened a new copy (aside from everything being punched out and already-organized in the box). However, below is a comprehensive list of all the ways this used copy is distinct from a band new copy. I&#039;m happy to send pictures of any of the below deviances:

(1) The most glaring, and therefore the first, thing to note is that this copy does not appear to contain item number 124. I never came across this item when playing through the campaign, but when I was reviewing all of the components, I noticed this item card appears to be missing. Here is a spoiler link to the card, in case you are interested: https://gloomhavendb.com/items/124. Other than this, all of the pieces in the game are present and accounted for. I have no idea how I misplaced that.
(2) There is some damage on one of the corners of the bottom box. It doesn&#039;t at all affect the usability or stability of the box, but is noticeable after you take off the top half.
(3) The Scoundrel and Brute minis have some painting already done on them.
(4) The permanent stickers for the first two scenarios are already on the map
(5) The donations tracker for the Sanctuary is already on the map
(6) A couple of the removable stickers are damaged. Most of the stickers for scenarios located on a crease on the map are cut in two, to allow for the map to fold. A Some of the stickers have some minor wrinkling that occurred when I removed them from the map
(7) A small smattering of class cards have enhancements on them. I didn&#039;t take the time to go through the cards and remove the 5-10 enhancements that I applied over the course of the campaign. They are all removable stickers, though, so it should be easy enough to take them off when you encounter them."/>
